  <p>"Thank you so much! Hey, since we're closing soon, I'll give you</p>
  <p>an extra bread roll on the house. Have a good evening!"</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>You thank the baker and head home with your pasteries. Your partner</p>
  <p>looks tired when they come back, but is rejuvinated when you share the</p>
  <p>pastries with them. You both eat the bread roll while throwing some</p>
  <p>crumbs for the birds that have gathered nearby.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>After having a light meal, you and your partner build a pillow fort around</p>
  <p>the sofa. You both sit around a candle and whisper stories in the dark.</p>
  <p>Soon, your partner falls asleep and you blow out the candle before doing the same.</p>
