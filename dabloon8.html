  <p>You thank the baker and leave with your pasteries. Shortly after, you</p>
  <p>cross paths with your partner, who is also on the way home. They are quite</p>
  <p>happy that you got a pastry for them. You both pause for a bit to enjoy the</p>
  <p>snacks and watch the first stars come out. You return home and share a meal.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>You both fall asleep while reading a book on the couch.</p>
