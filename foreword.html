<h1 style="color:FloralWhite;">Hello,</h1>

<p style="color:FloralWhite;">The following pages are not nearly as finished as I would like them to be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had a lot more story ideas and sketches for a more dynamic piece. However, I need to turn at least something in, so this is how it will remain for now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If any aspects of this website seem familiar, it's probably because some parts of this project were inspired by the website 'Mouchette'.</p>
<p></p>
<p style="color:FloralWhite;">Maybe I'll add more to it someday, but I'm not sure yet.</p>
