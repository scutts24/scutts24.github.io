<h1 style="color:FloralWhite;">Hello,</h1>

<p style="color:FloralWhite;">The following pages are not nearly as finished as I would like them to be. I</p>
<p></p>
<p>had a lot more ideas (story-wise, art-wise, and mechanic-wise) to create a</p>
<p></p>
<p>more dynamic piece. Plus, my original storylines were different from how it</p>
<p></p>
<p>actually turned out. However, I overestimated how much time I had and</p>
<p></p>
<p>underestimated how much time those things would take to do. Especially</p>
<p></p>
<p>considering how unfamiliar I am with programming in general. I had to scrap a</p>
<p></p>
<p>lot of those ideas. At least for now. As a result, I can't help but feel like</p>
<p></p>
<p>this is not as interesting of a story piece or art display as I would have</p>
<p></p>
<p>liked it to be. However, I need to turn at least something in, so this is</p>
<p></p>
<p>how it will remain for now. Maybe I'll add more to it someday. There were</p>
<p></p>
<p>supposed to be multiple outcomes, but some are still unfinished and will be</p>
<p></p>
<p>lacking dialogue or art. Some of them will be very easy to find, while others</p>
<p></p>
<p>may require a tiny bit more effort. Good luck. Have fun with it ig haha.</p>
