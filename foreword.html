<h1 style="color:FloralWhite;">Hello,</h1>

<p style="color:FloralWhite;">The following pages are not finished. I had a</p>
<p></p>
<p>lot more ideas (story-wise, art-wise, and mechanic-wise) to create a more</p>
<p></p>
<p>dynamic piece. Plus, my original storylines were different from how it</p>
<p></p>
<p>actually turned out. However, I overestimated how much time I had and</p>
<p></p>
<p>underestimated how much time those things would take to do. Especially</p>
<p></p>
<p>considering how unfamiliar I am with programming in general. I had to scrap a</p>
<p></p>
<p>lot of those ideas. This is not as interesting of a story or art piece</p>
<p></p>
<p>as I would have liked it to be. However, I need to turn at least something</p>
<p></p>
<p>in, so this is how it will remain for now. Maybe I'll add more to it someday.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were supposed to be multiple outcomes, but most are still unfinished.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of them would be very easy to find, while others would have</p>
<p></p>
<p>required a tiny bit more effort. Good luck. Have fun with it ig haha.</p>
