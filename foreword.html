<h1 style="color:FloralWhite;">Hello,</h1>

<p style="color:FloralWhite;">The following pages are not nearly as finished as I would like them to be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had a lot more ideas (story-wise, art-wise, and mechanic-wise) to create a more dynamic piece.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Plus, my original storylines were completely different from how it turned out.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, I overestimated how much time I had and underestimated how much time those things would take</p>
<p></p>
<p>to do. Especially considering how unfamiliar I am with programming in general.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I had to scrap a lot of those ideas. At least for now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a result, I can't help but feel like this is not as interesting of a story piece or art</p>
<p></p>
<p>display as I would have liked it to be. If you feel the story or art is lacking, I agree lol.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I need to turn at least something in, though, so this is how it will remain for now.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Maybe I'll add more to it someday, but I'm not sure yet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Either way, have fun looking through it, I guess.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Oh yea, there should be at least three or more different endings implemented so far.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Most of them will be very easy to find, but some of them may require a tiny bit more effort.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can you find them all?</p>
