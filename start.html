Well, now that you're here, I was thinking we could play the game we all used to play when we were younger. You know the one I'm talking about, right? We used to play it all the time before... <i>that</i>... happened. I know it's kind of childish, but I'm feeling rather nostalgic today. I think it would be a good way to remember her by. What do you think?"</p>

"Hi! It's good to see you. I was wondering when you were going to show up. Hehe. I have a game that I want you to try out. I used to play it with my friend all the time when we were kids. I haven't played it in years, but I'm feeling rather nostalgic today."
"Will you play the game? It's kinda easy, but super fun!"
