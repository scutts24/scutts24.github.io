"hey. how was school?"
   [''good''] or ['it was alright'], same outcome either way
>i heard we don't have to go back to school until after spring break. some cautionary measure, i guess.
"yea, i got an email about that. they're basically giving you a reason to be lazy for a few weeks. i don't see what the big deal is. it will probably just be over soon anyways, like flu season."
   [...]

*(spoiler alert: it was kind of a big deal, and it wasn't over soon)*

*(inside, day 175)*
"that's a nice laptop. isn't that a macbook?"
   ['yes'] or ['no'] but 'no' is not actually an option
>yea, it's a hand-me-down. i figured i'd use it for school since it's easy to carry around.
"that's cool. i'm thinking of buying another device soon so we have an extra one in case any of the other ones give us trouble while trying to join zoom."
   ['cool'] or ['alright']
"speaking of devices, where's that chromebook you borrowed from school? i've never seen you use it."
   ['i didn't borrow one']
>i never borrowed a chromebook. i figured my laptop was good enough, and i don't want to waste school resources by checking out something i wouldn't use.
"but you told me you were going to borrow a laptop. we talked about this over text before the new school year started."
   ['yea, and i told you i was not going to get one']
>yea, and i told you i was not going to borrow a school chromebook for the same reasons i said just now.
"you didn't say that at all. in fact, i asked you to do it so we could have an extra device on hand, and you promised that you would."
   ['that's not true'] or ['go back and check the texts'], same outcome
>that's not how i remember it. if it's really that big of an issue, just check the texts again or ask M for clarification.
"why are you always ganging up on me? i'm just trying to be a good parent and have fun with my kids, but then you do stuff like this and ruin our time together. plus, M would probably only side with you because everyone would rather placate you than be attacked by you all the time."
   ['but-']
>but i didn't even start this fight. we were just talking about laptops and then you got mad about something i didn't even do.
"i don't want to talk about this anymore. there's either something very wrong with you, or you're getting some sort of sick satisfaction by causing problems whenever i try to have a normal conversation. if your intent was to ruin the time we have together, good job."
