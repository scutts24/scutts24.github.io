<h1 style="color:FloralWhite;">Hello,</h1>

<p style="color:FloralWhite;">The following pages are not finished. I had a</p>
<p></p>
<p>lot more ideas (story-wise, art-wise, and mechanic-wise) to create a more</p>
<p></p>
<p>dynamic piece. Pretty much the same deal as with my other projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is more like a demo than a finished project. But I guess a demo can</p>
<p></p>
<p>be a final project as well? Or else there would be way too much dialogue</p>
<p></p>
<p>for the viewers to go through. It's hard to get the original concept across</p>
<p></p>
<p>without a lot of dialogue, so I hope this is a decent sampling of dialogue,</p>
<p></p>
<p>art, and gameplay to display at least some of the original concept.</p>
