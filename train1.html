<div class="dialogue">
  <p>The workday is finally over. Time to head home.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>You try to think about what you might do once you get back.</p>
  <p>Maybe you could pick up one of your old hobbies for a bit? You haven't done that in a while.</p>
  <p>Even though you are thinking of things you should enjoy doing, you only feel more tired.</p>
  <p>You'll probably just make leftovers and watch TV.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>Once you arrive at the usual subway platform, you open your most inescapable social media app</p>
  <p>so you can be bombarded by annoying people and out-of-touch ads on-screen as well as in real life.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>As you scroll through social media and pace along the subway platform, something catches your eye.</p>
  <p>There is a shiny penny on the ground. You know it's probably dirty, but you can't look away from it.</p>
