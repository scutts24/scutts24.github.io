idk i guess sorting by folders in my usual fashion JUST FUCKS SHIT UP so imma just add tags and those color code dot things that mac lets you put on crap

photos/gifs/videos: red dot
net art html files: orange dot
net art css files: yellow dot
p5js files: green dot

haha nvm just make a custom tag and change file sorting options to 'by tag', it's more specific that way
