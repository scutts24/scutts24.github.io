  <p style="color: floralwhite;">"I will hide four objects around my bedroom. The lights will be turned off so you have to try to find them all in the dark. Don't worry, I'll light some candles and put them on the furniture so you don't bump into anything. You won't be able to use any light sources to find the objects, though. The four hidden objects will be rocks I collected on the beach trip we took last summer. Once you find a rock, keep it with you and show them to me later so I know you found them all. I will be waiting outside in the hallway, and you are only allowed to come out once you find all of the rocks or forfeit the game.</p></div>
