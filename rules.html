<p>"In this game, there will be objects hidden around my bedroom. The lights will be turned off and you have to try to find them all in the dark. Don't worry, I'll light some candles and put them on the furniture so you don't bump into anything. You won't be allowed to move any of the candles, and you will not be able to bring any light sources in with you. I guess I'll go easy on you since it's your first time playing. I will hide five objects around the room, and those five objects will be rocks from the beach. Once you find a rock, tell me so I know how long it takes for you to find each one. I will be waiting outside in the hallway, and you are only allowed to come out once you find all of the rocks or forfeit the game.</p>
