  <p>"Alright, let me wrap that up for you. Your total is 4 dabloons.</p>
  <p>Thank you for coming in today! Enjoy!"</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>You thank the baker and leave with your pastry. You eat it happily on the</p>
  <p>way home. Your partner arrives shortly after and looks tired, so you cook</p>
  <p>dinner for them and eat together. They water the houseplants before going</p>
  <p>to sleep early, so you read for a bit and come to bed a few hours later.</p>
